* animations built into the core,
* support for a distributed runtime with a diagram client and a model server,
* a fast, reactive client architecure implemented in TypeScript,
* a Java-based server architecture,
* configuration via dependency injection,

The server part of sprotty is written in Java / [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) and is available via [Maven Central](http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/eclipse/sprotty/) or [JCenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/org/eclipse/sprotty/).
